GAI Syntax for Graph Creation:

Creating a Box:
Use makebox to create a new box. The format is:
makebox BoxName; XPosition; YPosition; BoxText

Creating an Arrow:
Use makearrow to create an arrow between two boxes. The format is:
makearrow Box1; Box2

Example of Graph Creation:

makebox Box1; 50; 50; Create Easy Graph
makebox Box2; Box1.x + 10; Box1.y + 100; With
makebox Box3; Box2.x + 10; Box2.y + 130; Small Graph Language

makearrow Box1; Box2
makearrow Box2; Box3

Explanation:
Creating a Box (makebox):
Each makebox command creates a box at the specified coordinates (XPosition and YPosition) with the text inside (BoxText).
Creating an Arrow (makearrow):
The makearrow command connects two boxes by their names, creating a directional arrow from one to the other.
Dynamic Positioning with .x and .y:
The .x and .y values allow you to dynamically position boxes relative to others. For example, Breakfast.x and Breakfast.y +50 will place the "Breakfast" box below the "Wake Up" box with a vertical offset of 50 pixels.

Separating Arguments:
Each argument is separated by a semicolon (;) for clarity and consistency in the command structure.
Graph Creation Tips:
Box Positioning:
When placing boxes, ensure that their coordinates don't overlap. This is critical for creating a readable and aesthetically pleasing graph. Use .x and .y to adjust positions dynamically as you add new boxes.

Arrow Direction:
Arrows should logically connect the flow of information. Make sure each makearrow reflects the intended order of actions or events in the graph.

Spacing and Layout:
Leave sufficient space between boxes and arrows to maintain visual clarity. Consider the layout before starting to add too many boxes to avoid a cluttered design.

Information:
Each box have width 120 pixels. Keep this in mind to create beautiful and understandable graphs
